Using the computeGrade() in Grades class from Problem 3 we answered questions regarding
a) different valid inputs.
b) differnt outputs.
c) 3 different different black box testing cases.
/**

answers:

a) As we ca obtain maximum marks of:
   Assignments = 32/30 (2 bonus marks) {32 valid inputs}
   Project     = 8/5   (3 bonus marks) {8 valid inputs}
   Tutorials   = 10/10                 {10 valid inputs}
   Quizzes     = 5/5                   {5 valid inputs}
   Midterm     = 15/15                 {15 valid inputs}
   Final Exam  = 35/35                 {35 valid inputs}

therfore altogther we have a combination of 105 valid inputs.

b) Our marks can only range from a 0 to 100, even with respect to 5 bonus marks.
   therefore:
   
   i) 100 valid outputs with respect to Final Grade.
  ii) Error message if 6 arguments are not met.

Hence, altogether we have a cobination of 101 valid putputs. 

c) These black box tests were done on DrJava:

/* This is testing for extreme cases, taking full marks including bonus to check if 100 is the only output produced. */
> run Grades 32 8 10 5 15 35 (input)
Your Final Grade is: 100     (output)
same

/* This was test if grades is at boundary of midterm + final_Grade = 25
> run Grades 14 3 8 5 10 15
Your Final Grade is: 55
same

/* This is to test in case of midterm + final_Grade < 25 then it picks the minimum of input values. */
> run Grades 5 5 5 5 5 10 (input)
Your Final Grade is: 30   (output)
same

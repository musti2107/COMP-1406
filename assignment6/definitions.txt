=== Black Box Testing ===
It is a method of testing in which we have no access of data structuring, trhe algorithm involved nor can we see the actual code involved. 

=== White Box Testing ===
Its where we are aware of the knowledge of the data structuring while testing also we know the details of the algorithm used and the actual code present. 

=== Access Modifiers === 
An access modifier is a permission setting for our attributes and methods so that they will be visible/modifiable/usable from some places in our code but not from other places.
(Private/Protected/Public)

=== Non-access Modifiers ===
Allows a method to be called without creating an instance of a class. 

=== Primitive Data ===
represents a single simple p[iece of information. 

=== Object ===
represents multiple pieces of information that are grouped together. It is an instantiation of a class, 
It holds STATE of an object anf operation built within it 'BEHAVIOR'. 

=== Class === 
It specifies what sort of data can be stored. It also defines the operations on that data. 
It can have its own functionality. 

=== Data Type === 
It is a det of values and a set of operations defined on those values. 

=== Procedural Programming ===
A sequence of precedural methods that modify the state of the data. 
Each procedure does one thing. 

=== Modular Programming ===
Breaking up programming into multiple modules (classes). 
Individual functionality. 

=== Object Oriented Programming ===
A collection of interacting objects. Objects have both states and behaviour. 
Involves Encapsulation, Inheritence, Polymorphism. 

===  Static Area === 
Area of the memory that is used by the global and static variables that are defined by out program. 
It is fixed and does not change as the program runs. 

=== Free Memory ===
Memory that is not currently being used by our program. 

=== Stack ===
Memory used to store local variables. 

=== Heap ===
Memory that stores all objects that we create. 

=== Object Constructors ===
It is a chunk of code that we write in our classes,
that will allow is to hide disturbance of setting all the initial values for our objects each time we use them. 

=== Overloading ===
Two methods in the same class with the same name, 
this is called overloading. Overloading is only allowed if the similar-named methods have a different set of parameters.

=== Instance Methods ===
Represent behaviors (functions and procedures) that are to be performed on the particular object,
that we called the method for (i.e., the receiver of the method). 

=== Class Methods ===
Represent behaviors (functions and procedures) that are performed on a class.

=== Encapsulation ===
Involves enclosing an object with a kind of protection so that it cannot be accessed or modified without proper permission.

=== Inheritance ===
It is the act of receiving shared attributes and behavior from more general types of objects up the hierarchy.

=== Concrete Class ===
It is a class in JAVA that we can make instances of directly by using the new keyword. 

=== Abstract Class === 
It is a class for which we cannot create instances. Valid reference data type. Method declaration and definitions defines identity of children.
Class extends 0, 1 abstaract class. All subclasses are related. 

=== Abstract Method === 
It is a  method with no code for which all concrete subclasses are forced to implement the method.

=== Interface ===
It is a specification (i.e., a list) of a set of methods such that any classes 
implementing the interface are forced to write these methods. Class implements n>=0 interfaces.
Independent classes implement same interface. 

=== Polymorphism === 
It is the ability to use the same behavior for objects of different types. 

=== Astract data type (ADT) ===
It is a mathematical model for a certain class of data structures that have similar behavior.

=== List ADT ===
It is an abstract data type that implements an ordered collection of values, 
where the same value may occur more than once. 

=== Stack ADT ===
ordered collection of data (top is the last item added )
 push (add an element to the top)
 pop (remove top element)
Last In First Out (LIFO)
 peek (look at the top)
 isEmpty (is the stack empty)

=== Que ADT === 
It is an abstract data type that stores elements in a first-in-first-out order.
Elements are added at one end and removed from the other. 
. Priority que - a queue in which removal is based on a priority. Highest priority item removed first. 
. Deque - a double-ended queue. Allows arbitrary adding/removing from front and back.

=== Set ADT === 
An unordered collection of data that does not allow duplicate elements to be added. 

=== Map/Dictionary ADT ===
ADT that stores a collection of unique keys and their associated values. 
Each key is associated with a single value or a set of values. 
Mutable keys are dangerous. Some maps have order and some do not.

=== Generic ===
Allows us to create methods that use/input/return any data type (non-primitive).

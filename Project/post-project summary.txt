Post Project Summary

*/

1. The most challenging aspect was completeing the project within time with oter assignments and studying do complete. 
   While also, making sure everything important is ticked off from the rubic list. 

2. Having not worked with java prior to this course, and beig able to do a project with a team taught be time management and also
   not to forget it taught me how java originally works. making classes, putting in conditions, extending classes creating logic, and then testing that 
   same logic to what we imagined it to be. 

3. My contribution was equally matched to the other members inthe team .Everyone gave their 100% to this project, from sleepless nights to early morning testings.
   2 other members and myself specifically worked on the players and the field so our part very much imprtant and the project relied on our completion.

4. Stanley - was efficient and wiling to learn what he did not understand and gave his 100%.
   Ehsan - He did bulk of the typing and programming because of his skill of fast typing and grasping oncepts quick. He put in 100% as well.
   Daihee - He was given the TEAM CLASS to complete on his own and presented us with one very well written and organized commenting on time.

   For all the members in team, we have same courses next semester and have spoken to each other to work once again in a team as we gell very well together and back each other up good.
   So definitely looking to work with them next semester!
